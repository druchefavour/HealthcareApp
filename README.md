# HealthcareApp: Healthcare Scheduling System

This app enables administrators in the healthcare industry and clients to access certified medical professionals. Healthcare administrators would be able to access nurses to fill the overwhelming void of nurses in the industry while patients would be able to request a professional to come and service their light medical needs without the need of hospitals and doctor's bills. 

The app uses Google API to call the location of nurses, and PayPal API for payment. Ajax is used for pullin data from the server. 

The script is written using Javascript/ JQuery library. The final product has a polished frontend/UI using Bootstrap CSS framework. Firebase is used for persistent data storage. The app is mobile responsive and is deployed in heroku.
